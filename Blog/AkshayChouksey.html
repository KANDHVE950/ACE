<p> Namit also
  achieved a close to impossible feat
  by not only securing a rank but also acing the ESE 2017 within just six months
  of preparation. He came to Delhi and
  enrolled in a coaching institute in June
  2016. He sates that he greatly relied on
  the coaching material as it provided him
  a filtered syllabus with focus on scoring as
  much as possible in the exam. He referred
  to standard books only during the interview preparations.Namit stresses on the
  importance of studying current affairs for
  the exam and he during his preparation he used to study current affairs every morning before starting his core subject studies
  for the day.He believes in an integrated approach for preparing for the mains and the
  prelims rather than studying separately for
  each.</p>

        <h4>For The Interview round,</h4>
<p>Namit emphasized
  on the fact that the Detailed Application
  Form (DAF) which is given before the interview, should be filled very meticulously. It
  can be instrumental in turning the tide of the
  interview in the candidate’s favour.
  Namit kept connected with his friends from
  college who has previously cracked the
  exam. He states that it really helped him
  monitor his growth throughout his preparation.</p>

</br>
<p>In addition to the UPSC – ESE, Namit has
  also cleared various other exams such as
  GATE, BARC, PGCIL and IOCL.</p>

</br>
<p>
  He plans to join the railway sector after his
  training.</p>
  
</br>
  <p>

  and was an active participant in various extra-curricular activities, especially those pertaining to music as loves to play the guitar
